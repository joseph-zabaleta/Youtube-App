## Overview

This is an application created using React v17. Overall purpose is to practice and showcase best practices around building a React Application. Some of the key features include: resuable components, functional components, react hooks, and making HTTP request to a third party API.

### React vs Vue.js

I have created this application in both React.js and Vue.js. They are not exactly built the same in terms of styling libraries but they logic and components are similiar. Please checkout the Vue repository below to compare the two!
